            "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello there and welcome back to &lt;em&gt;Keep Reading: Analyzing the So Spake Martin Archive for Future Story Hints&lt;/em&gt; series where we&amp;#39;re going though the &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/\"&gt;So Spake Martin archive&lt;/a&gt; that Elio Garcia Jr and Linda Antonsson maintain and cultivate and looking at places where George RR Martin has said or hinted at upcoming events in a story before the event is featured in the story, and then, turn around and talk about how that event is revealed in the published version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we said last time: For those unfamiliar, the So Spake Martin archive is a running site listing every last damn thing George RR Martin has said about ASOIAF all the way from 1990 to the present. It&amp;#39;s a great and valuable resource, and I encourage all of you to &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/\"&gt;visit the site&lt;/a&gt; and take a gander at what&amp;#39;s there if you&amp;#39;ve never done so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this may be of interest to those who love ASOIAF trivia, but also, we might be able to get a sense of the future of the story of ASOIAF from the hints that GRRM teases out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last week, we covered &lt;em&gt;A Clash of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Storm of Swords&lt;/em&gt;, but here&amp;#39;s our schedule:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/88cfo9/spoilers_extended_keep_reading_analyzing_the_so/\"&gt;Looking at all the pre-publication hints for &lt;em&gt;A Clash of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Storm of Swords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Ditto, but for &lt;em&gt;A Feast for Crows&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Sworn Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Mystery Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Ditto, but for &lt;em&gt;A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The World of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Ditto but for &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Dream of Spring&lt;/em&gt; and future &lt;em&gt;Dunk and Egg&lt;/em&gt; novellas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I intend to publish each part in the upcoming Fridays. So, part 2 comes out today, part 3 on April 13 and part 4 on April 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is going to be little analysis proper from me except when necessary. It&amp;#39;ll be mostly George RR Martin talking and me quoting the places in the books this happens and then bullet-pointing some of the larger topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did some light editing of the So Spake Martins for clarity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;AFFC&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little bit of background about &lt;em&gt;A Feast for Crows.&lt;/em&gt; Originally, it wasn&amp;#39;t on the docket at all. The original plan was that a five-year gap would occur after the end of &lt;em&gt;A Storm of Swords&lt;/em&gt; with the next book being &lt;em&gt;A Dance with Dragons.&lt;/em&gt; However, in late 2001, GRRM decided to abandon the five-year gap. What resulted was two books:&lt;em&gt;A Feast for Crows&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Dance with Dragons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, AFFC would have all of the POVs in the book, but in early 2005, GRRM made the decision to split the book&amp;#39;s POVs by location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please note here that pre-2002, GRRM refers to events upcoming in &amp;quot;ADWD&amp;quot; when they actually come out in published form in AFFC. That aside, let&amp;#39;s dive into it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What &amp;#39;valar dohaeris&amp;#39; means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll learn what &amp;quot;valar dohaeris&amp;quot; means in A Dance with Dragons. (Ed Note: Recall that AFFC wasn&amp;#39;t envisioned at this point in George&amp;#39;s head. This reveal occurs in AFFC) - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1432\"&gt;SSM, 9/1/1999&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Kindly Man tells Arya in AFFC the definition in her 2nd chapter:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All men must serve beneath this roof. Valar dohaeris is how we say it here.&amp;quot; (AFFC, Arya II)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Westerling Role in the Red Wedding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rania asks GRRM about the Westerlings and which of them knew of the plot (Rania assumes Jeyne was aware, but isn&amp;#39;t sure about her brothers) and was Jeyne purposefully thrown at Robb?]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; Interesting observations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Jaime&amp;#39;s final chapter, it&amp;#39;s made clear that Sybel Spicer knew of the plot, but that Jeyne did not:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is a question I must ask you. Are you carrying his child, my lady?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeyne burst from her chair and would have fled the room if the guard at the door had not seized her by the arm. \u201cShe is not,\u201d said Lady Sybell, as her daughter struggled to escape. \u201cI made certain of that, as your lord father bid me.\u201d (AFFC, Jaime VII)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerys and Rhaegar&amp;#39;s Tense Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Am I reading things between the lines that aren&amp;#39;t really there, but was Rhaegar and Aerys&amp;#39; relationship not all that it could be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; There were definitely tensions between father and son. More will be revealed in future books. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1121\"&gt;SSM, 8/26/2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The full extent of this hasn&amp;#39;t been revealed, but in AFFC, Jaime remembers Rhaegar and his desire to call a council as a result of his father&amp;#39;s wrongdoing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rhaegar had put his hand on Jaime\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhen this battle\u2019s done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but... well, it does no good to speak of roads not taken. We shall talk when I return.\u201d (AFFC, Jaime I)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cersei and Her Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tigers14: btw, i think that with tywin dead and tyrion on the run, the crown under cersei is going to have trouble&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM&lt;/strong&gt;: Cersei will have some challenges, certainly - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1128\"&gt;SSM, 9/6/2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cersei has many challenges in AFFC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cersei as a POV Character&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in another thread that I asked GRRM if we would ever see a Cersei POV. He said that he is considering it. He thinks that it would be interesting to write but that he is not certain that it would be necessary to further the plotline. If it&amp;#39;s not necessary, he probably won&amp;#39;t write it. &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1262\"&gt;SSM, 11/16/2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interesting that before GRRM started writing AFFC/ADWD, he was considering Cersei as a POV. In the published version of AFFC, she has the most POV chapters of any characters with 10. If you&amp;#39;re curious what Cersei&amp;#39;s chapters looked like in early form, &lt;a href=\"/u/jen_snow\"&gt;/u/jen_snow&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/57zaas/spoilers_extended_asoiaf_archives_september_2000/\"&gt;fabulous post&lt;/a&gt; about this a year and a half ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Return of Gendry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My friend (who is a big Gendry fan) asked him, &amp;quot;Will Gendry come back?&amp;quot; He said yes, and &amp;quot;laughed mysteriously.&amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1258\"&gt;SSM, 11/8/2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gendry returns to the narrative in Brienne&amp;#39;s seventh chapter as Ser Gendry Waters, knight sworn to the service of the Brotherhood without Banners:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThieves,\u201d said a boy\u2019s voice from the stables. \u201cRobbers.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brienne turned, and saw a ghost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renly.&lt;/em&gt; No hammerblow to the heart could have felled her half so hard. \u201cMy lord?\u201d she gasped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLord?\u201d The boy pushed back a lock of black hair that had fallen across his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just a smith.\u201d (AFFC, Brienne VII)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dorne in AFFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another driplet missing from my reports: I asked if we were going to Dorne in DoD, and GRRM said &amp;quot;Yes. Briefly.&amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1257\"&gt;SSM, 11/8/2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this early juncture, GRRM planned to &amp;quot;visit&amp;quot; Dorne. However, after he abandoned the five-year gap, Dorne became one of the central locations of AFFC with 4 chapters taking place in Dorne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Story in store for Brienne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I very much enjoy the character of Brienne! A great portrayal of a strong woman with heart! Her athletic skill exceeds any existing female, but in fantasy writing, things can be exaggerated for the author&amp;#39;s purposes, correct? At any rate, I thought her great physical strength was effective as part of her character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM&lt;/strong&gt;: I am fond of Brienne as well, and have a lot more in store for her. I&amp;#39;m glad that you&amp;#39;ve enjoyed the character. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1147\"&gt;SSM, 1/3/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brienne has eight chapters in AFFC with a lot of story occuring in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lannisters Coming to the Fore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another question I&amp;#39;ve wanted to ask for some time, is concerning the Lannisters. Given Tywin&amp;#39;s death and Tyrion&amp;#39;s exile, the Lannisters appears to have suffered a &lt;em&gt;grievous&lt;/em&gt; brain drain. Will there be other Lannisters to come forth and take their place (&amp;#39;intellectually&amp;#39; speaking, that is)? Daven Lannister, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; There will be other Lannisters who will =try= to come forth and take their places, undoubtedly. Ser Daven, as you mention, though Ser Kevan is considerably more senior and more experienced. And do not neglect the women. Only Kevan remains of Tywin&amp;#39;s three brothers, but there was a sister as well. A younger generation is coming up as well, and there are more distant cousins and the like too. The Lannisters are a large family. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1159\"&gt;SSM, 3/11/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ser Daven shows up first in the narrative when Cersei names him Warden of the West over Kevan Lannister, and then we meet him in person while he&amp;#39;s besieging Riverrun in Jaime&amp;#39;s fifth chapter. Ser Kevan is present in Jaime and Cersei&amp;#39;s chapters in AFFC as well. Cersei attempts to name him Hand -- which doesn&amp;#39;t go so well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rennifer Longwaters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most legitimate sons of bastards keep the bastard name, but there are cases where a later generation fiddles with it to remove the taint. There&amp;#39;s one such case that you will meet in the next book, a minor character descended from a Waters (a bastard name along the shores of Blackwater Bay) whose great grandfather changed the name to Longwaters for just that reason. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2999\"&gt;SSM, 6/26/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The character we meet in AFFC is Rennifer Longwaters: the chief undergoaler that Jaime encounters in his first chapter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam and the Horn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does Sam still have the horn that Jon found with the obsidian?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1169\"&gt;SSM, 6/19/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Samwell keeps the horn with him throughout AFFC and takes it with him to Oldtown. On the Cinnamon Wind, the &amp;quot;broken horn&amp;quot; is one of the few things that the crew of the ship leave with Samwell:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the time the dealing was done, Sam was down to his boots and blacks and smallclothes, and the broken horn Jon Snow had found on the Fist of First Men. (AFFC, Samwell IV)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faceless Men Origin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway to the purpose of my communication I am intrigued by the Faceless Men and was wondering if you could give any further info on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; I will, but not in a letter. Keep reading the books. Here&amp;#39;s your crumb: they are very old, their interests go further, they originated in Valyria before the fall, and their core organizing principle is religious. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Kindly Man reveals some of the Faceless Men&amp;#39;s backstory and history to Arya:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe tale of our beginnings. If you would be one of us, you had best know who we are and how we came to be. Men may whisper of the Faceless Men of Braavos, but we are older than the Secret City. Before the Titan rose, before the Unmasking of Uthero, before the Founding, we were. We have flowered in Braavos amongst these northern fogs, but we first took root in Valyria, amongst the wretched slaves who toiled in the deep mines beneath the Fourteen Flames that lit the Freehold\u2019s nights of old. (AFFC, Arya II)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Faceless Men Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How long does it take to train as a Faceless Man, is the training formal taking place in some sort of academy, or, is it by way of apprenticeship. Basically could you tell me anything to curb my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;ll need to wait for the next book to learn more. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1168\"&gt;SSM, 6/13/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We find out in Arya&amp;#39;s first chapter that the Faceless Men train at the House of Black and White: a temple of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left-Handed Jaime and Fightin&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And now (surprise, surprise), the questions. 1- With time and effort (say, the five years between ASOS and ADWD), can Jaime learn to fight left-handed, like Quorin Halfhand did?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; He&amp;#39;s going to have to find out, I suspect. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1165\"&gt;SSM, 6/19/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jaime begins training left-handed with Ser Ilyn Payne on the journey to Riverrun and continues his training with the tongueless headsman while at Riverrun and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will control House Lannister now that Tywin is dead?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now that Tywin Lannister is dead, will it be Kevan or Cersei who will assume control of House Lannister (and the throne)? I&amp;#39;m assuming that Jaime cannot because he&amp;#39;s in the Kingsguard and seems to want to remain there. Whether it&amp;#39;s Kevan or Cersei, there&amp;#39;s bound to be trouble. Cersei is shortsighted, quick to take offense, and very protective of her children (I think that&amp;#39;s why she had a knight of the Kingsguard try to kill Tyrion), whereas Kevan was used to taking orders from his older brother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry, that&amp;#39;s another you&amp;#39;ll need to wait for the next book to resolve. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1165\"&gt;SSM, 6/19/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit of a thorny issue. Cersei rules as Queen Regent. Daven is Warden of the West. Jaime is Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Kevan Lannister will eventually take the regency from Cersei before being killed by Varys in ADWD, but the technical answer is that Cersei wields the most power in AFFC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The history of Braavos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What about the Braavosi? They leave the impression of being culturally related to Westeros (like medieval Italy to France, for example), or is it just my illusion?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; Braavos is the odd duck among the Nine Free Cities, but still more Valyrian than Andal in its origins. You&amp;#39;ll learn more of its history next book. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1250\"&gt;SSM, 7/22/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sam and Arya learn bits about the history of Braavos in AFFC -- though more of the history is spelled out in TWOIAF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New POV Character&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The identity of the other new POV is something he&amp;#39;s keeping a secret for now, but he did say its a character with a story to tell that really can&amp;#39;t wait. My money is on the Hound. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1267\"&gt;SSM, 9/1/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably Brienne of Tarth -- who George planned as a POV character for AFFC from the outset. The Ironborn and Dornish POVs come along later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening Funeral&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will there be more important weddings (and funerals) in ADwD?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; A big funeral right to start with in AFFC. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1187\"&gt;SSM, 11/4/2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The funeral that kicks off AFFC is the funeral for Tywin Lannister as seen in Jaime and Cersei&amp;#39;s POV chapters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Females on Stage in AFFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of females on stage in A FEAST FOR CROWS, by the way. The women are taking over... - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1209\"&gt;SSM, 3/27/2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just by POV alone, we have:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cersei&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Brienne&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arya&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sansa/Alayne&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Asha&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arianne&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cersei will not be a saint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope Cersei will not became a &amp;quot;saint&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; Small chance of that. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1208\"&gt;SSM, 3/26/2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No analysis needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Euron in AFFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if you could tell me if Euron CrowEye is a faceless man himself or if he simply hired a faceless man? Will we see more of Euron? He seems like a great idea for a character and id love to see you develop him somemore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; Euron is not a faceless man. Yes, you&amp;#39;ll see the Crow&amp;#39;s Eye in A FEAST FOR... hey, what a coincidence... - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1206\"&gt;SSM, 3/21/2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we definitely see Euron in AFFC. It&amp;#39;s interesting here that GRRM kind of underplays the significance of Euron before the publication of AFFC. He&amp;#39;s a huge presence in the books. So, when you see GRRM saying &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll see X-character in TWOW&amp;quot;, don&amp;#39;t just assume x-character will be of minor significance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brynden Tully&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I for one hope we haven&amp;#39;t heard the last of the Blackfish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; The Blackfish will be seen in A FEAST FOR CROWS, have no fear. In fact, I was working on a scene with him and Jaime just the other day. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1204\"&gt;SSM, 3/19/2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is the famous parlay that Jaime and Brynden have at the Riverrun drawbridge:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBlackfish,\u201d he responded. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI assume you have returned to fulfill the oaths you swore my niece,\u201d Ser Brynden said. \u201cAs I recall, you promised Catelyn her daughters in return for your freedom.\u201d His mouth tightened. \u201cYet I do not see the girls. Where are they?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Must he make me say it?&lt;/em&gt; \u201cI do not have them.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPity. Do you wish to resume your captivity? Your old cell is still available. We have put fresh rushes on the floor.\u201d (AFFC, Jaime VI)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Locations in AFFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I asked him which of the places we never saw before, he is going to show us, he said that there will be quite some scenes on the Iron Islands, and also Braavos and Dorne. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1278\"&gt;SSM, 4/20/2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nagga&amp;#39;s Bones, Water Gardens, Sunspear, Braavosi docks, inns and temples all feature in AFFC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fallout from Oberyn&amp;#39;s Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During Q &amp;amp; A, GRRM revealed what seemed to be the major reason for the five year gap. He said that he realized something. He had to deal with the reaction to Oberyn&amp;#39;s death in Dorne. He thought of different ways that he could handle things. He could have just summarized what happened, without talking about it very much, but he did not want to do this. He could have decided that for some reason there was no reaction, or a delayed reaction, but the reasons he could come up for to do that did not make sense. So, he finally realized that the story needed to be told. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1281\"&gt;SSM, 8/23/2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons why GRRM abandoned the five-year gap is the effect it would have on Dorne. He felt that the immediate after-effects should be seen, and thus we got Arianne, Arys and Areo&amp;#39;s chapters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strongboar Crakehall in AFFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Martin, I find the Crakehall family very interesting. It&amp;#39;s one of many tidbits that make me want to know more. Will we learn more about House Crakehall in future volumes?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;ll see a few glimpses of Strongboar in FEAST, for what it&amp;#39;s worth. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1251\"&gt;SSM, 6/3/2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strongboar accompanies Jaime into the Riverlands and acts as part of Jaime&amp;#39;s war-councils in and around Riverrun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandor in AFFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will we see Sandor again, especially in replacing Sansa&amp;#39;s lost wolf?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, we will see Sandor (in the next book I think he said) and Gregor. After that, he said he can&amp;#39;t comment on the rest... - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1337\"&gt;SSM, 5/30/2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gregor we see as Ser Robert Strong in ADWD, but Sandor appears in AFFC. First, he&amp;#39;s misidentified as the person raping and pillaging the Riverlands (It&amp;#39;s Rorge and the Bloody Mummers), but then, as we all know, we almost certainly see him as the gravedigger at the Quiet Isle:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most were boys near Podrick\u2019s age, or younger, but there were grown men as well, amongst them the big gravedigger they had encountered on the hill, who walked with the awkward lurching gait of one half-crippled. (AFFC, Brienne VI)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rumors About POV Characters Not in AFFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another bit of information that I found interesting- we &lt;em&gt;WILL&lt;/em&gt; hear about the POVs who will not have front stage as it were, but will have it in ADwD. The reports of those chars will be somewhat garbled and messy as can be expected from any news that has travelled that distance and is that important. ex) Varys&amp;#39; manipulation of the Dany information, or Theon&amp;#39;s skinning of the miller&amp;#39;s information (we didn&amp;#39;t know it wasn&amp;#39;t Bran and Rickon until later). &lt;em&gt;THOSE&lt;/em&gt; are the kind of reports we will see in AFFC about the missing POVs. We will get information on them, but have no idea which parts, if any, are correct. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1333\"&gt;SSM, 5/27/2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been fascinated by rumors in ASOIAF (maybe a potential post someday), but we do get lots of information filtering back to our AFFC POVs about other POV characters -- especially Daenerys. Dany and her dragons feature strongly in the Prologue as Pate and the other Citadel acolytes talk about her. Meanwhile, Cersei Lannister&amp;#39;s small council talks about Jon Snow as well Jon Connington and the plans of the Golden Company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesbian Sex-Scenes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;George was asked if there&amp;#39;d be any more sex scenes involving two women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, there&amp;#39;s one in A Feast for Crows, and it does not involve Daenerys. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1348\"&gt;SSM, 8/4/2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yup, it&amp;#39;s the Myrish Swamp:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cersei cupped the other woman\u2019s breast. Softly at first, hardly touching, feeling the warmth of it beneath her palm, the skin as smooth as satin. She gave it a gentle squeeze, then ran her thumbnail lightly across the big dark nipple, back and forth and back and forth until she felt it stiffen. (AFFC, Cersei VII)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Dunk and Egg&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my disappointments in doing this project is the lack of information about &lt;em&gt;The Sworn Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Mystery Knight.&lt;/em&gt; There are a few things, but they are &lt;strong&gt;few.&lt;/strong&gt; Anyways, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM wants to write sequels to THE HEDGE KNIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE will eventually run to six books, so I still have three and a half to write. That will keep me busy for quite a few years. After that, there&amp;#39;s no telling what I&amp;#39;ll do. If I do eventually write a prequel to ICE AND FIRE, however, it will not concern the overthrow of Aerys II. I&amp;#39;d go back earlier than that, and follow up with Dunk and Egg from &amp;quot;The Hedge Knight.&amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/961\"&gt;SSM, 1/5/1999&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Silverberg did another Legends and asked me in again, sure, I&amp;#39;d love to do the next tale of Dunk and Egg. - &lt;a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20001210110800/http://www.eventhorizon.com:80/sfzine/chats/transcripts/031899.html\"&gt;Event Horizon Chat with GRRM, 3/1999&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just heard rumours of a planned sequel to LEGENDS, could you confirm this. Assuming you plan to contribute to another short story collection would your piece be another tale of Dunk and Egg?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRRM:&lt;/strong&gt; If LEGENDS II does indeed happen -- that is not entirely certain as I write -- I will indeed contribute a second Dunk and Egg story, &amp;quot;The Sworn Sword.&amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1197\"&gt;SSM, 1/27/2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far back as the &amp;#39;90s, GRRM had a sequel in mind for &lt;em&gt;The Hedge Knight.&lt;/em&gt; The problem was that he couldn&amp;#39;t find an anthology to put it in:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sworn Sword occurs a few years after The Hedge Knight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He is doing a story for Legends 2 that is about Dunk and Egg a couple of years after the Hedge Knight. That should be cool. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1288\"&gt;SSM, 2/14/2003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Significant time passes between novella 1 and 2 with &lt;em&gt;The Sworn Sword&lt;/em&gt; occurring during a time of drought in Westeros.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mystery Knight was written in rough draft form by 2004&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He already has a 3rd Dunk and Egg story written and will probably finish it after he completes AFfC. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1305\"&gt;SSM, 9/2/2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In going through the SSMs, the information somewhat shifts. Various people reports that GRRM is &amp;quot;nearly done&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;The Mystery Knight&lt;/em&gt;, while others says he&amp;#39;s only &amp;quot;half-done&amp;quot; and others still saying he needs to &amp;quot;write it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Tourneys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be more tourneys, in the Dunk and Egg books. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1320\"&gt;SSM, 5/6/2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tourney at Whitewalls features heavily in &lt;em&gt;The Mystery Knight&lt;/em&gt; with the prize of the dragon eggs being offered (this is all a cover for another Blackfyre Rebellion though):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s slow. Are we going to go to Whitewalls, ser?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why not? I want to see this dragon&amp;#39;s egg.&amp;quot; Dunk smiled. &amp;quot;If I win the tourney, we&amp;#39;d both have dragon&amp;#39;s eggs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Egg gave him a doubtful look. (D&amp;amp;E, TMK)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wedding and a Tourney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The next Dunk &amp;amp; Egg story will largely involve a wedding and a tournament. He hasn&amp;#39;t decided on a title. - &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1381\"&gt;SSM, 11/18/2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in addition to the tourney that GRRM talked about, he also had a wedding in mind. The tourney at Whitewalls was ostensibly there to celebrate the marriage of Lord Butterwell (but we know better):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well met, ser. Come, ride with us to Whitewalls and break a few lances to help Lord Butterwell celebrate his new marriage. I&amp;#39;ll wager you could give a good account of yourself.&amp;quot; (D&amp;amp;E, TMK)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#39;s a lot. I really hope you&amp;#39;ve gotten something out of this, and I do strongly urge you all to take advantage of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/\"&gt;So Spake Martin archive&lt;/a&gt; that Elio and Linda maintain. There&amp;#39;s a lot of fascinating stuff in there. Additionally, there&amp;#39;s a great little resource that &lt;a href=\"/u/HollowayDivision\"&gt;/u/HollowayDivision&lt;/a&gt; did which allows you to search for any topic you&amp;#39;d like to from the So Spake Martin archive.

            "##Intro\n\nHello there and welcome back to *Keep Reading: Analyzing the So Spake Martin Archive for Future Story Hints* series where we're going though the [So Spake Martin archive](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/) that Elio Garcia Jr and Linda Antonsson maintain and cultivate and looking at places where George RR Martin has said or hinted at upcoming events in a story before the event is featured in the story, and then, turn around and talk about how that event is revealed in the published version.\n\nAs we said last time: For those unfamiliar, the So Spake Martin archive is a running site listing every last damn thing George RR Martin has said about ASOIAF all the way from 1990 to the present. It's a great and valuable resource, and I encourage all of you to [visit the site](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/) and take a gander at what's there if you've never done so.\n\nMy hope is that this may be of interest to those who love ASOIAF trivia, but also, we might be able to get a sense of the future of the story of ASOIAF from the hints that GRRM teases out. \n\nLast week, we covered *A Clash of Kings* and *A Storm of Swords*, but here's our schedule:\n\n- **Part 1:** [Looking at all the pre-publication hints for *A Clash of Kings* and *A Storm of Swords*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/88cfo9/spoilers_extended_keep_reading_analyzing_the_so/)\n- **Part 2:** Ditto, but for *A Feast for Crows*, *The Sworn Sword* and *The Mystery Knight*\n- **Part 3:** Ditto, but for *A Dance with Dragons* and *The World of Ice and Fire*\n- **Part 4:** Ditto but for *The Winds of Winter*, *A Dream of Spring* and future *Dunk and Egg* novellas.\n\nI intend to publish each part in the upcoming Fridays. So, part 2 comes out today, part 3 on April 13 and part 4 on April 20.\n\nThere is going to be little analysis proper from me except when necessary. It'll be mostly George RR Martin talking and me quoting the places in the books this happens and then bullet-pointing some of the larger topics.\n\nI did some light editing of the So Spake Martins for clarity. \n\n***\n##AFFC\n\nA little bit of background about *A Feast for Crows.* Originally, it wasn't on the docket at all. The original plan was that a five-year gap would occur after the end of *A Storm of Swords* with the next book being *A Dance with Dragons.* However, in late 2001, GRRM decided to abandon the five-year gap. What resulted was two books:*A Feast for Crows* and *A Dance with Dragons.*\n\nInitially, AFFC would have all of the POVs in the book, but in early 2005, GRRM made the decision to split the book's POVs by location.\n\nSo please note here that pre-2002, GRRM refers to events upcoming in \"ADWD\" when they actually come out in published form in AFFC. That aside, let's dive into it!\n\n**What 'valar dohaeris' means**\n\n&gt; We'll learn what \"valar dohaeris\" means in A Dance with Dragons. (Ed Note: Recall that AFFC wasn't envisioned at this point in George's head. This reveal occurs in AFFC) - [SSM, 9/1/1999](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1432)\n\nThe Kindly Man tells Arya in AFFC the definition in her 2nd chapter:\n\n&gt; \"All men must serve beneath this roof. Valar dohaeris is how we say it here.\" (AFFC, Arya II)\n\n**The Westerling Role in the Red Wedding**\n\n&gt; Rania asks GRRM about the Westerlings and which of them knew of the plot (Rania assumes Jeyne was aware, but isn't sure about her brothers) and was Jeyne purposefully thrown at Robb?]\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** Interesting observations.\n\nIn Jaime's final chapter, it's made clear that Sybel Spicer knew of the plot, but that Jeyne did not:\n\n&gt; \"There is a question I must ask you. Are you carrying his child, my lady?\u201d \n\n&gt; Jeyne burst from her chair and would have fled the room if the guard at the door had not seized her by the arm. \u201cShe is not,\u201d said Lady Sybell, as her daughter struggled to escape. \u201cI made certain of that, as your lord father bid me.\u201d (AFFC, Jaime VII)\n\n**Aerys and Rhaegar's Tense Relationship**\n\n&gt; Am I reading things between the lines that aren't really there, but was Rhaegar and Aerys' relationship not all that it could be?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** There were definitely tensions between father and son. More will be revealed in future books. - [SSM, 8/26/2000](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1121)\n\nThe full extent of this hasn't been revealed, but in AFFC, Jaime remembers Rhaegar and his desire to call a council as a result of his father's wrongdoing:\n\n&gt; Rhaegar had put his hand on Jaime\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhen this battle\u2019s done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but... well, it does no good to speak of roads not taken. We shall talk when I return.\u201d (AFFC, Jaime I)\n\n**Cersei and Her Challenges**\n\n&gt; Tigers14: btw, i think that with tywin dead and tyrion on the run, the crown under cersei is going to have trouble\n\n&gt; **GRRM**: Cersei will have some challenges, certainly - [SSM, 9/6/2000](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1128)\n\nCersei has many challenges in AFFC.\n\n**Cersei as a POV Character**\n\n&gt; I mentioned in another thread that I asked GRRM if we would ever see a Cersei POV. He said that he is considering it. He thinks that it would be interesting to write but that he is not certain that it would be necessary to further the plotline. If it's not necessary, he probably won't write it. [SSM, 11/16/2000](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1262)\n\nInteresting that before GRRM started writing AFFC/ADWD, he was considering Cersei as a POV. In the published version of AFFC, she has the most POV chapters of any characters with 10. If you're curious what Cersei's chapters looked like in early form, /u/jen_snow wrote a [fabulous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/57zaas/spoilers_extended_asoiaf_archives_september_2000/) about this a year and a half ago.\n\n**The Return of Gendry**\n\n&gt; My friend (who is a big Gendry fan) asked him, \"Will Gendry come back?\" He said yes, and \"laughed mysteriously.\" - [SSM, 11/8/2000](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1258)\n\nGendry returns to the narrative in Brienne's seventh chapter as Ser Gendry Waters, knight sworn to the service of the Brotherhood without Banners:\n\n&gt; \u201cThieves,\u201d said a boy\u2019s voice from the stables. \u201cRobbers.\u201d \n \n&gt; Brienne turned, and saw a ghost. \n\n&gt; *Renly.* No hammerblow to the heart could have felled her half so hard. \u201cMy lord?\u201d she gasped. \n\n&gt; \u201cLord?\u201d The boy pushed back a lock of black hair that had fallen across his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just a smith.\u201d (AFFC, Brienne VII)\n\n**Dorne in AFFC**\n\n&gt; Another driplet missing from my reports: I asked if we were going to Dorne in DoD, and GRRM said \"Yes. Briefly.\" - [SSM, 11/8/2000](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1257)\n\nAt this early juncture, GRRM planned to \"visit\" Dorne. However, after he abandoned the five-year gap, Dorne became one of the central locations of AFFC with 4 chapters taking place in Dorne.\n\n**More Story in store for Brienne**\n\n&gt; I very much enjoy the character of Brienne! A great portrayal of a strong woman with heart! Her athletic skill exceeds any existing female, but in fantasy writing, things can be exaggerated for the author's purposes, correct? At any rate, I thought her great physical strength was effective as part of her character.\n\n&gt; **GRRM**: I am fond of Brienne as well, and have a lot more in store for her. I'm glad that you've enjoyed the character. - [SSM, 1/3/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1147)\n\nBrienne has eight chapters in AFFC with a lot of story occuring in them.\n\n**Lannisters Coming to the Fore**\n\n&gt; Another question I've wanted to ask for some time, is concerning the Lannisters. Given Tywin's death and Tyrion's exile, the Lannisters appears to have suffered a _grievous_ brain drain. Will there be other Lannisters to come forth and take their place ('intellectually' speaking, that is)? Daven Lannister, perhaps?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** There will be other Lannisters who will =try= to come forth and take their places, undoubtedly. Ser Daven, as you mention, though Ser Kevan is considerably more senior and more experienced. And do not neglect the women. Only Kevan remains of Tywin's three brothers, but there was a sister as well. A younger generation is coming up as well, and there are more distant cousins and the like too. The Lannisters are a large family. - [SSM, 3/11/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1159)\n\nSer Daven shows up first in the narrative when Cersei names him Warden of the West over Kevan Lannister, and then we meet him in person while he's besieging Riverrun in Jaime's fifth chapter. Ser Kevan is present in Jaime and Cersei's chapters in AFFC as well. Cersei attempts to name him Hand -- which doesn't go so well.\n\n**Rennifer Longwaters**\n\n&gt; Most legitimate sons of bastards keep the bastard name, but there are cases where a later generation fiddles with it to remove the taint. There's one such case that you will meet in the next book, a minor character descended from a Waters (a bastard name along the shores of Blackwater Bay) whose great grandfather changed the name to Longwaters for just that reason. - [SSM, 6/26/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2999)\n\nThe character we meet in AFFC is Rennifer Longwaters: the chief undergoaler that Jaime encounters in his first chapter.\n\n**Sam and the Horn**\n\n&gt; Does Sam still have the horn that Jon found with the obsidian?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** Yes. - [SSM, 6/19/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1169)\n\nSamwell keeps the horn with him throughout AFFC and takes it with him to Oldtown. On the Cinnamon Wind, the \"broken horn\" is one of the few things that the crew of the ship leave with Samwell:\n\n&gt; By the time the dealing was done, Sam was down to his boots and blacks and smallclothes, and the broken horn Jon Snow had found on the Fist of First Men. (AFFC, Samwell IV)\n\n**Faceless Men Origin**\n\n&gt; Anyway to the purpose of my communication I am intrigued by the Faceless Men and was wondering if you could give any further info on them.\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** I will, but not in a letter. Keep reading the books. Here's your crumb: they are very old, their interests go further, they originated in Valyria before the fall, and their core organizing principle is religious. \n\nThe Kindly Man reveals some of the Faceless Men's backstory and history to Arya:\n\n&gt; \u201cThe tale of our beginnings. If you would be one of us, you had best know who we are and how we came to be. Men may whisper of the Faceless Men of Braavos, but we are older than the Secret City. Before the Titan rose, before the Unmasking of Uthero, before the Founding, we were. We have flowered in Braavos amongst these northern fogs, but we first took root in Valyria, amongst the wretched slaves who toiled in the deep mines beneath the Fourteen Flames that lit the Freehold\u2019s nights of old. (AFFC, Arya II)\n\n**More Faceless Men Stuff**\n\n&gt; How long does it take to train as a Faceless Man, is the training formal taking place in some sort of academy, or, is it by way of apprenticeship. Basically could you tell me anything to curb my curiosity.\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** You'll need to wait for the next book to learn more. - [SSM, 6/13/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1168)\n\nWe find out in Arya's first chapter that the Faceless Men train at the House of Black and White: a temple of sorts.\n\n**Left-Handed Jaime and Fightin'**\n\n&gt; And now (surprise, surprise), the questions. 1- With time and effort (say, the five years between ASOS and ADWD), can Jaime learn to fight left-handed, like Quorin Halfhand did?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** He's going to have to find out, I suspect. - [SSM, 6/19/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1165)\n\nJaime begins training left-handed with Ser Ilyn Payne on the journey to Riverrun and continues his training with the tongueless headsman while at Riverrun and beyond.\n\n**Who will control House Lannister now that Tywin is dead?**\n\n&gt; Now that Tywin Lannister is dead, will it be Kevan or Cersei who will assume control of House Lannister (and the throne)? I'm assuming that Jaime cannot because he's in the Kingsguard and seems to want to remain there. Whether it's Kevan or Cersei, there's bound to be trouble. Cersei is shortsighted, quick to take offense, and very protective of her children (I think that's why she had a knight of the Kingsguard try to kill Tyrion), whereas Kevan was used to taking orders from his older brother.\n\n&gt; Sorry, that's another you'll need to wait for the next book to resolve. - [SSM, 6/19/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1165)\n\nA bit of a thorny issue. Cersei rules as Queen Regent. Daven is Warden of the West. Jaime is Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Kevan Lannister will eventually take the regency from Cersei before being killed by Varys in ADWD, but the technical answer is that Cersei wields the most power in AFFC.\n\n**The history of Braavos**\n\n&gt; What about the Braavosi? They leave the impression of being culturally related to Westeros (like medieval Italy to France, for example), or is it just my illusion?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** Braavos is the odd duck among the Nine Free Cities, but still more Valyrian than Andal in its origins. You'll learn more of its history next book. - [SSM, 7/22/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1250)\n\nSam and Arya learn bits about the history of Braavos in AFFC -- though more of the history is spelled out in TWOIAF.\n\n**New POV Character**\n\n&gt; The identity of the other new POV is something he's keeping a secret for now, but he did say its a character with a story to tell that really can't wait. My money is on the Hound. - [SSM, 9/1/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1267)\n\nThis is probably Brienne of Tarth -- who George planned as a POV character for AFFC from the outset. The Ironborn and Dornish POVs come along later on.\n\n**Opening Funeral**\n\n&gt; Will there be more important weddings (and funerals) in ADwD?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** A big funeral right to start with in AFFC. - [SSM, 11/4/2001](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1187)\n\nThe funeral that kicks off AFFC is the funeral for Tywin Lannister as seen in Jaime and Cersei's POV chapters.\n\n**Females on Stage in AFFC**\n\n&gt; A lot of females on stage in A FEAST FOR CROWS, by the way. The women are taking over... - [SSM, 3/27/2002](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1209)\n\nJust by POV alone, we have:\n\n- Cersei\n- Brienne\n- Arya\n- Sansa/Alayne\n- Asha\n- Arianne\n\n**Cersei will not be a saint**\n\n&gt; I hope Cersei will not became a \"saint\".\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** Small chance of that. - [SSM, 3/26/2002](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1208)\n\nNo analysis needed.\n\n**Euron in AFFC**\n\n&gt; I was wondering if you could tell me if Euron CrowEye is a faceless man himself or if he simply hired a faceless man? Will we see more of Euron? He seems like a great idea for a character and id love to see you develop him somemore.\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** Euron is not a faceless man. Yes, you'll see the Crow's Eye in A FEAST FOR... hey, what a coincidence... - [SSM, 3/21/2002](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1206)\n\nYeah, we definitely see Euron in AFFC. It's interesting here that GRRM kind of underplays the significance of Euron before the publication of AFFC. He's a huge presence in the books. So, when you see GRRM saying \"You'll see X-character in TWOW\", don't just assume x-character will be of minor significance. \n\n**Brynden Tully**\n\n&gt; I for one hope we haven't heard the last of the Blackfish.\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** The Blackfish will be seen in A FEAST FOR CROWS, have no fear. In fact, I was working on a scene with him and Jaime just the other day. - [SSM, 3/19/2002](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1204)\n\nThis, of course, is the famous parlay that Jaime and Brynden have at the Riverrun drawbridge:\n\n&gt; \u201cBlackfish,\u201d he responded. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d \n\n&gt; \u201cI assume you have returned to fulfill the oaths you swore my niece,\u201d Ser Brynden said. \u201cAs I recall, you promised Catelyn her daughters in return for your freedom.\u201d His mouth tightened. \u201cYet I do not see the girls. Where are they?\u201d \n\n&gt; *Must he make me say it?* \u201cI do not have them.\u201d \n\n&gt; \u201cPity. Do you wish to resume your captivity? Your old cell is still available. We have put fresh rushes on the floor.\u201d (AFFC, Jaime VI)\n\n**New Locations in AFFC**\n\n&gt; When I asked him which of the places we never saw before, he is going to show us, he said that there will be quite some scenes on the Iron Islands, and also Braavos and Dorne. - [SSM, 4/20/2002](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1278)\n\nNagga's Bones, Water Gardens, Sunspear, Braavosi docks, inns and temples all feature in AFFC.\n\n**The Fallout from Oberyn's Death**\n\n&gt; During Q &amp; A, GRRM revealed what seemed to be the major reason for the five year gap. He said that he realized something. He had to deal with the reaction to Oberyn's death in Dorne. He thought of different ways that he could handle things. He could have just summarized what happened, without talking about it very much, but he did not want to do this. He could have decided that for some reason there was no reaction, or a delayed reaction, but the reasons he could come up for to do that did not make sense. So, he finally realized that the story needed to be told. - [SSM, 8/23/2002](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1281)\n\nOne of the main reasons why GRRM abandoned the five-year gap is the effect it would have on Dorne. He felt that the immediate after-effects should be seen, and thus we got Arianne, Arys and Areo's chapters.\n\n**Strongboar Crakehall in AFFC**\n\n&gt; Mr. Martin, I find the Crakehall family very interesting. It's one of many tidbits that make me want to know more. Will we learn more about House Crakehall in future volumes?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** You'll see a few glimpses of Strongboar in FEAST, for what it's worth. - [SSM, 6/3/2004](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1251)\n\nStrongboar accompanies Jaime into the Riverlands and acts as part of Jaime's war-councils in and around Riverrun.\n\n**Sandor in AFFC**\n\n&gt; Will we see Sandor again, especially in replacing Sansa's lost wolf?\n\n&gt; Yes, we will see Sandor (in the next book I think he said) and Gregor. After that, he said he can't comment on the rest... - [SSM, 5/30/2005](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1337)\n\nGregor we see as Ser Robert Strong in ADWD, but Sandor appears in AFFC. First, he's misidentified as the person raping and pillaging the Riverlands (It's Rorge and the Bloody Mummers), but then, as we all know, we almost certainly see him as the gravedigger at the Quiet Isle:\n\n&gt; Most were boys near Podrick\u2019s age, or younger, but there were grown men as well, amongst them the big gravedigger they had encountered on the hill, who walked with the awkward lurching gait of one half-crippled. (AFFC, Brienne VI)\n\n**Rumors About POV Characters Not in AFFC**\n\n&gt; Another bit of information that I found interesting- we *WILL* hear about the POVs who will not have front stage as it were, but will have it in ADwD. The reports of those chars will be somewhat garbled and messy as can be expected from any news that has travelled that distance and is that important. ex) Varys' manipulation of the Dany information, or Theon's skinning of the miller's information (we didn't know it wasn't Bran and Rickon until later). *THOSE* are the kind of reports we will see in AFFC about the missing POVs. We will get information on them, but have no idea which parts, if any, are correct. - [SSM, 5/27/2005](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1333)\n\nI've always been fascinated by rumors in ASOIAF (maybe a potential post someday), but we do get lots of information filtering back to our AFFC POVs about other POV characters -- especially Daenerys. Dany and her dragons feature strongly in the Prologue as Pate and the other Citadel acolytes talk about her. Meanwhile, Cersei Lannister's small council talks about Jon Snow as well Jon Connington and the plans of the Golden Company.\n\n**Lesbian Sex-Scenes**\n\n&gt; George was asked if there'd be any more sex scenes involving two women.\n\n&gt; Yes, there's one in A Feast for Crows, and it does not involve Daenerys. - [SSM, 8/4/2005](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1348)\n\nYup, it's the Myrish Swamp:\n\n&gt; Cersei cupped the other woman\u2019s breast. Softly at first, hardly touching, feeling the warmth of it beneath her palm, the skin as smooth as satin. She gave it a gentle squeeze, then ran her thumbnail lightly across the big dark nipple, back and forth and back and forth until she felt it stiffen. (AFFC, Cersei VII)\n\n***\n##Dunk and Egg\n\nOne of my disappointments in doing this project is the lack of information about *The Sworn Sword* and *The Mystery Knight.* There are a few things, but they are **few.** Anyways, here we go:\n\n**GRRM wants to write sequels to THE HEDGE KNIGHT**\n\n&gt; A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE will eventually run to six books, so I still have three and a half to write. That will keep me busy for quite a few years. After that, there's no telling what I'll do. If I do eventually write a prequel to ICE AND FIRE, however, it will not concern the overthrow of Aerys II. I'd go back earlier than that, and follow up with Dunk and Egg from \"The Hedge Knight.\" - [SSM, 1/5/1999](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/961)\n\n&gt; If Silverberg did another Legends and asked me in again, sure, I'd love to do the next tale of Dunk and Egg. - [Event Horizon Chat with GRRM, 3/1999](http://web.archive.org/web/20001210110800/http://www.eventhorizon.com:80/sfzine/chats/transcripts/031899.html)\n\n&gt; I've just heard rumours of a planned sequel to LEGENDS, could you confirm this. Assuming you plan to contribute to another short story collection would your piece be another tale of Dunk and Egg?\n\n&gt; **GRRM:** If LEGENDS II does indeed happen -- that is not entirely certain as I write -- I will indeed contribute a second Dunk and Egg story, \"The Sworn Sword.\" - [SSM, 1/27/2002](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1197)\n\nAs far back as the '90s, GRRM had a sequel in mind for *The Hedge Knight.* The problem was that he couldn't find an anthology to put it in:\n\n**The Sworn Sword occurs a few years after The Hedge Knight**\n\n&gt; He is doing a story for Legends 2 that is about Dunk and Egg a couple of years after the Hedge Knight. That should be cool. - [SSM, 2/14/2003](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1288)\n\nSignificant time passes between novella 1 and 2 with *The Sworn Sword* occurring during a time of drought in Westeros.\n\n**The Mystery Knight was written in rough draft form by 2004**\n\n&gt; He already has a 3rd Dunk and Egg story written and will probably finish it after he completes AFfC. - [SSM, 9/2/2004](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1305)\n\nIn going through the SSMs, the information somewhat shifts. Various people reports that GRRM is \"nearly done\" *The Mystery Knight*, while others says he's only \"half-done\" and others still saying he needs to \"write it.\"\n\n**More Tourneys**\n\n&gt; There will be more tourneys, in the Dunk and Egg books. - [SSM, 5/6/2005](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1320)\n\nThe Tourney at Whitewalls features heavily in *The Mystery Knight* with the prize of the dragon eggs being offered (this is all a cover for another Blackfyre Rebellion though):\n\n&gt; \"It's slow. Are we going to go to Whitewalls, ser?\"\n\n&gt; \"Why not? I want to see this dragon's egg.\" Dunk smiled. \"If I win the tourney, we'd both have dragon's eggs.\"\n\n&gt; Egg gave him a doubtful look. (D&amp;E, TMK)\n\n**Wedding and a Tourney**\n\n&gt; The next Dunk &amp; Egg story will largely involve a wedding and a tournament. He hasn't decided on a title. - [SSM, 11/18/2005](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1381)\n\nSo in addition to the tourney that GRRM talked about, he also had a wedding in mind. The tourney at Whitewalls was ostensibly there to celebrate the marriage of Lord Butterwell (but we know better):\n\n&gt; \"Well met, ser. Come, ride with us to Whitewalls and break a few lances to help Lord Butterwell celebrate his new marriage. I'll wager you could give a good account of yourself.\" (D&amp;E, TMK)\n\n***\n##Conclusion\n\nSo, that's a lot. I really hope you've gotten something out of this, and I do strongly urge you all to take advantage of the [So Spake Martin archive](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/) that Elio and Linda maintain. There's a lot of fascinating stuff in there. Additionally, there's a great little resource that /u/HollowayDivision did which allows you to search for any topic you'd like to from the So Spake Martin archive.

Whoo! /u/glass_table_girl and I are pleased to to present our continuing series to help us better understand the characters and world of ASOIAF by doing a shallow to deep dive on a member of House Frey. \n\nThis week, let's take a look at the brother of Walder Frey's current heir, and all-around bad dude, Black Walder Frey.\n\n---\n\n##The Story So Far \n(summaries drawn from [the wiki](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Walder_Frey_(son_of_Ryman)).)\n\n###A Clash of Kings\n\nBlack Walder comes up in Big Walder and Little Walder's discussions with Bran of the Frey family succession. As Freys die, he moves up in the line of succession.\n\n###A Storm of Swords\n\nWhile initially Robb's ally on the battlefield, he is one of the most outspoken against Robb's marriage to Jeyne Westerling that breaks his marriage pact with the Freys. He is quoted as saying \"his sisters would not be loath to wed a widower,\" taunting Robb by threatening to murder his new wife.

Later, Black Walder of course participates in the slaughter of the Stark's allies. (Side note: Black Walder is represented as a player in the Frey family in the show, with his character and the bastard Walder Rivers rolled into one \"Black Walder Rivers.\")\n\n###A Feast for Crows\n\nBlack Walder is busy during this book, resolving the siege of Seagard by threatening to kill his captive, Patrek Mallister, and leading the search for the Brotherhood Without Banners gang responsible for the hanging of his brother Petyr and uncle Merrett Frey. While he is on Lady Stonheart's trail, he is yet unable to track her down. Upon Ser Ryman Frey's death, his older brother Edwyn remarks that he suspects Black Walder had a role in it, even though it is made to look like a BWB hanging.\n\n---\n\n## Who is Black Walder?\n\nWith so many Walder Freys running about, they have to distinguish them all somehow. Black Walder's hair and countenance do indeed run black, but his nickname is likely a result of his temper, his stern attitude, and his dastardly deeds. With his serial philandering, he is attempting to erode the foundations of the Frey family by calling scores of heirs into question. He is said to have had affairs with the wives of his brothers, Edwyn and Petyr, his neice Fair Walda, and his half-cousin Amerei (but really who hasn't?) among others. \"Best pick [a Frey girl] who hasn't flowered yet, or I'm like to find that Black Walder has been there first,\" says Daven Lannister. There is a rumor that he even had an ongoing relationship with Lord Frey's young seventh wife, Annara Farring, obscuring the paternity of the youngest Frey brothers. More explicitly, it is entirely likely he has plotted the murder of several close family members. Edwyn is right to watch his back.\n\n---\n\n##How far from Lord Frey? \n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll show how each Frey is related to Lord Walder. \n\n* Black Walder is the younger brother of Edwyn Frey, current heir to the twins. Edwyn has no sons, and so Black Walder is his heir. Their other brother, Petyr \"Pimple\" is currently deceased. \n\n* Black Walder and Edwyn are sons of Ryman, first son of Stevron, first son of Lord Walder Frey by his first wife.\n\n* Black Walder refuses to marry, and while he likely has a few Frey children, he has no official heirs. \n\n* With Black Walder's lack of a legacy, should Edwyn and Black Walder die the Twins pass to Ser Stevron's (fourth) son with his third wife, Walton Frey (the children with his second wife being the deceased Aegon \"Jinglebell\" Frey, and a daughter, Maegelle).\n\n---\n\n##Frey Pies Scale \n\n**Savory or Sweet?** If eldest brother Edwyn takes more after his somewhat noble grandfather, Black Walder is his father's son, but with a pinch of motivation and scheming. Not content to take out other noble families, Black Walder is doing the job of undermining his own family from the inside.\n\n**How many pies?** On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least and 5 being the most, how much would you like to kill this character? \n\n5 pies. As I said with his father, good riddance. When they say \"Had he lived, he would have grown up to be a Frey,\" they're talking about Freys like this. He's on LSH's trail, but will she find him first? For this co-conspirator of the Red Wedding, the sequel starring the BWB can't come soon enough.\n\n---\n##Discussion\n\nSo, readers, what do you think about Black Walder Frey? Bad or Worst? Despicable or Incorrigible?\n\nAnd let us know, what Frey should we cover next week? ",

How are you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I Always said, even though I adore GRR Martin\u2019s writing I feel like the way he describes some of the costumes in the books is\u2026. Well, a little bit tacky (sorry if I offend anyone), and even though I love the costumes from the brilliant Michele Clapton \u2013I think she is an absolute genius- when I am reading the books I always imagined the costumes to be more historically accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a while ago I did a post on this subreddit where I expresses my opinion on the costumes from the song of ice and fire saga, and you seemed to like it very much so I decided to create a series of posts where I explain get more into details with each and every region.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love fashion, I love art and I love history, but most importantly, I LOVE GOT/ASOIAF, so this is going to very fun to make! Please feel free to express your opinion in the comments below \ud83d\ude0a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, I have to say that I have based all the clothing into a timeline from 1480 \u2013 1520 (well, at least most of them haha), Why did I decided to go for renaissance period costumes? Because I find the costumes to be astonishingly beautiful and most importantly because I feel that Westeros is up for a big change, Robert\u2019s rebellion, the war of the five kings, the war for the dawn and the Targaryen restoration\u2026 I feel like we are slowly abandoning \u201cthe medieval times\u201d and going directly into the renaissance. Or at least I hope so.\nSecond of all, in this posts I am going to talk a little bit of the regions, the climate, the economic strength, and I will focus on the nobility and common folk, however I will not get too much into armours/weapons because I Don\u2019t have enough knowledge to cover those aspects, forgive me.\nSo today we are starting with one of my favourite regions, Dorne, I love it, it\u2019s mysterious, exotic, liberal and\u2026..cheesy, very cheesy and tacky, especially when it comes to the fashion choices that the characters make. No, seriously, Arianne is the princess of Dorne and goes almost naked with a lot of jewels, from the way George makes her outfits, she looks more like Kim Kardashian than a true dornish princess. By that I am not saying that women should not explore and enjoy their sexuality, but you have to take in account that Westeros is based on a medieval land, image is key, and even though Dorne is very sexually liberating, there are certain standards that the prince/princess of Dorne needs to maintain.\nWithout further or do, let\u2019s go to Dorne, shall we?\n \u201cDorne is the large peninsula which makes up the southernmost part of Westeros, and is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms. The lords of the ruling House Nymeros Martell style themselves &amp;quot;Prince&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Princess&amp;quot; in the Rhoynish fashion.[1]\nDorne is the hottest region of Westeros. The region is rocky, mountainous, arid and dry, and features the only desert on the continent\u201d\nFrom that definition, we must find a culture that is rich, elegant but at the same time practical because the people from Dorne need to survive the heat. That\u2019s why I decided to go for an Arab/Ottoman empire influences along with costumes from another countries.\nI have to say it was excruciatingly hard to find the right costumes, mainly because I didn\u2019t know much about arab/ottoman culture when it came to fashion, but I tried my best, I hope you like it.\nThere are three typed of inhabitants in Dorne, the stony dornishmen, the salty dornishmen and the sandy dornishmen.\nOn one hand, we have the stony dornishmen, who are described as \u201chaving fair of skin, freckle or burn in the sun, and have brown or blond hair\u201d, and also they have the most andal (= European) blood and first men blood among the dornishmen, so I played with that a little bit.\nThe costumes that I went for belong to the period referred as the English restauration, I know, you are reading it right, and I know that those costumes belongs to the 17th century, however, the costumes that I am going to show you were heavily inspired by Greek/renaissance fashion, they were loose and comfortable yet they still were sensual and elegant, very European, so I think it will go great with the stony dornishmen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/ff/d9/a6/ffd9a6c6bc5e9753207285459371ee6d--lady-diana-diane.jpg\"&gt;https://i.pinimg.com/236x/ff/d9/a6/ffd9a6c6bc5e9753207285459371ee6d--lady-diana-diane.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/a4/45/07a445c81c3e8b3ad6f9b18b810a28fc.jpg\"&gt;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/a4/45/07a445c81c3e8b3ad6f9b18b810a28fc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/museum/media/images/web/enlarge/00077401.jpg\"&gt;http://www.getty.edu/museum/media/images/web/enlarge/00077401.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/89/74/b3/8974b330ae0b91856f32455a888689c3.jpg\"&gt;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/89/74/b3/8974b330ae0b91856f32455a888689c3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the sandy dornishmen, live in the deserts and long river valleys, they have faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun, they are even darker than the salty Dornishmen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case I went for the north African/arab costumes, the costumes Don\u2019t need to be fashionable, they need to be practical in order to survive the extremely hot temperatures and the sandy winds of the desert of Dorne. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b6/a0/9d/b6a09df6936aecef27e5eb7f84842c15.jpg\"&gt;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b6/a0/9d/b6a09df6936aecef27e5eb7f84842c15.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://c8.alamy.com/comp/BFXWH6/arab-men-in-traditional-clothing-BFXWH6.jpg\"&gt;http://c8.alamy.com/comp/BFXWH6/arab-men-in-traditional-clothing-BFXWH6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ee/04/e9/ee04e98b3084a2eebb84c5db08b9afcf.jpg\"&gt;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ee/04/e9/ee04e98b3084a2eebb84c5db08b9afcf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sandy dornishmen are not particularly rich, however there are two notable houses, the Ullers and the Qorgyles, their style is much more simple and practical when you compare it to the style of the stony dornishmen and the salty dornishmen, their faces are covered with vales to protect themselves from the sun and the sand, but they are nobles so they need to keep appereiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://teleprograma.diezminutos.es/var/plan_site/storage/images/series_tv/2013/abril/la_alhambra_acoge_la_grabacion_de_la_segunda_temporada_de_isabel/isabelaixa/6446127-1-esl-ES/isabelaixa_gallery_a.jpg\"&gt;http://teleprograma.diezminutos.es/var/plan_site/storage/images/series_tv/2013/abril/la_alhambra_acoge_la_grabacion_de_la_segunda_temporada_de_isabel/isabelaixa/6446127-1-esl-ES/isabelaixa_gallery_a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://teleprograma.diezminutos.es/var/plan_site/storage/images/series_tv/2013/abril/la_alhambra_acoge_la_grabacion_de_la_segunda_temporada_de_isabel/isabelelzagal2/6446162-1-esl-ES/isabelelzagal2_gallery_a.jpg\"&gt;http://teleprograma.diezminutos.es/var/plan_site/storage/images/series_tv/2013/abril/la_alhambra_acoge_la_grabacion_de_la_segunda_temporada_de_isabel/isabelelzagal2/6446162-1-esl-ES/isabelelzagal2_gallery_a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then we have the salty dornishmen, they live along the coasts, mainly along the Broken Arm region, where the Red Mountains stretch out into the Sea of Dorne. These Dornishmen are lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair, having been most strongly influenced by the Rhoynar. The Martells are the perfect example of salty dornishmen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to be somewhat faithful to the books and I looked for sensuality, which is a common trait among all the dornish charactes, but I still wanted them to look elegant and somewhat graceful, sadly, I didn\u2019t find many noble portraits, so I decided to look for harem paintings from the ottoman empire, and I think it perfectly fits the description of Book Dorne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/f2/21/5df2211d8e67815d9b228a5b629423be.jpg\"&gt;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/f2/21/5df2211d8e67815d9b228a5b629423be.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.pictorem.com/collection/900_The%20merchant.jpg\"&gt;http://www.pictorem.com/collection/900_The%20merchant.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://img2.rtve.es/imagenes/alex-martinez-boabdil-patio-leones/1370974230272.jpg\"&gt;http://img2.rtve.es/imagenes/alex-martinez-boabdil-patio-leones/1370974230272.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.royal-painting.com/largeimg/Moritz%20Stifter/45368-Moritz%20Stifter-In_The_Harem.jpg\"&gt;https://www.royal-painting.com/largeimg/Moritz%20Stifter/45368-Moritz%20Stifter-In_The_Harem.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.paintinghere.org/Uploadpic/Franz%20Von%20Defregger/big/Idle%20Hours%20in%20the%20Harem.jpg\"&gt;http://www.paintinghere.org/Uploadpic/Franz%20Von%20Defregger/big/Idle%20Hours%20in%20the%20Harem.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I loved this portrait of a girl wearing these beautiful baggy trousers, I found it sexy and empowering at the same time, just like Dorne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/width-600/public/images/frank_dicksee_leila_1892.jpg\"&gt;http://www.tate.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/width-600/public/images/frank_dicksee_leila_1892.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I had been thinking about the upcoming season of the show and started going thru plot points that have lined up in the books vs the show. And I had a random thought...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which child&amp;#39;s death will really break Cersei?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know the saying of &amp;quot;Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds...&amp;quot; Part of what Maggie the Frog said, but I wonder if the means will align with the show or go a different route.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we have Myrcella in Dorne, and as far as we know she&amp;#39;s alive (although unable to enjoy a full set of earbuds). I know there are theories about her being dead and replaced or some other things, but for this let&amp;#39;s assume she&amp;#39;s still alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have Tommen (remember still a kid) stamping papers as his adoring wife, Margaery looks on and does her best to mold him. Without Cersei being there for a good bit of time we see Tommen get friendly with the new Queen and under Kevans rule things start to grow calm in the Red Keep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, who goes first? And how?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well we know the saying refers to their golden crowns before shrouds. We knkw the upheaval in Dorne was done to crown Myrcella, since ages is the determining factor in ruling in Dorne, not what is between your legs. I think that after the debacle with Sephiroth, mean Darkstar, she&amp;#39;s only going to have so many ways her end could come:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She does die from the wounds, plain and simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkstar comes back to finish the job. He is still out there. But that brings up a whole other list of questions like &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s his endgame?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Is he working for someone?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myrcella makes the trip back to Kings Landing as requested, but is killed along the way by some means (I know it&amp;#39;s vauge but there are too many cards on the table we can&amp;#39;t flip over yet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we have Tommen to consider too. Will Cersei do something that will make a small boy take his life? Or will things just fall in to a dark line stained in Lannister blood?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory (one of them)? Cersei will demand a trial by battle. We know this is her plan, if Tommen doesn&amp;#39;t have it declared outlawed then we know she will pick Ser Robert Strong. Who would the faith choose? No idea. But what if during the fight a sword gets launched or a shield breaks and sends a lethal missile towards the child king? His death would be basically at Cersei&amp;#39;s hands. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My only issue is that this would leave Margaery still as Queen. So I guess she would have to be dealt with first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t see a small boy taking his life. Sure, being sad and upset his mother is a horrible murder, I mean he&amp;#39;s only about nine at this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if Cersei takes out the Sept or the Tyrells and doesn&amp;#39;t realize Tommen is there? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many thoughts is my head sorry for jumping from each to another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Myrcella will in some way be crowned before her death. Either in Dorne, or legally if Tommen dies first. Though she may inherit the crown, I don&amp;#39;t think we will see her on the Iron Throne. I have this nagging feeling Darkstar may be closer then we think, waiting to start the war of Dorne vs Lannister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry this may be a jumble, it&amp;#39;s late, I have taken my nightly meds so eyes are getting heavy. But let&amp;#39;s sum it up...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tommen is pulling away from Cersie. So perhaps he becomes collateral damage. Myrcella becomes Queen, maybe heads to Kings Landing but doesn&amp;#39;t make it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Myrcella will be the one that breaks Cersei. She always has sweet thoughts of her and seems to love her dearly. Myrcella is not there to see her mother unravel, and therefore would still think kindly on her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I do think Tommen will goes first. But his sister will follow quickly. Possible that she dies from the ambush set up for her betrothed on the journey back to Kings Landing. What if Cersei doesn&amp;#39;t call it off in time? Or Myrcella rushes to save her sweet prince and takes the blow herself?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that becomes the case it&amp;#39;s another reason for someone like Jamie to kill Cersei after another plan that led to another death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man, I am ready for TWOW...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nighty night!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Tommen will die first, Myrcella will be named Queen but won&amp;#39;t make it to the Iron Throne thus breaking Cersei and allowing whichever little brother you imagine to kill her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
